 * @brief This file only exists so that a "CMake Error: Cannot determine link
 * language for target LeetcodeDSALib" does not get thrown during CMake
 * generation. This error will be thrown anytime that you are building a header-
 * only library, i.e. there are no source files in src/.
 * 
 * TODO: There is probably a better way to deal with building a header-only
 * library.
