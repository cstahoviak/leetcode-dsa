The following is an overview of the Data Structures and Algorithms covered by this course. The following tables detail the data structure or algorithm, the relevent C++ implementations, and the applciable problem types that should be solved using that particular data structure or algorithm.

## Data Structures
Data Structures overview.

| Data Structure       | C++ Implementation | Features | Applicable Problem Types |
|:---------------------|:-------------------|:---------|:-------------------------|
| Hash Map/ Hash Table | `std::map`<br> `std::unordered_map`<br> `std::set`<br> `std::unordered_set`<br> `std::multimap`<br> `std::unordered_multimap` | - __Access__, __insertion__, __removal__ and __checking the existence__ of an element can __ALL__ be done in $O(1)$ on average, $O(n)$ worst case.<br> - Only `multimaps` allow duplicate keys. | - Checking if an element/item exists.<br> - Counting/frequency of items in a collection.|
| Linked List          | N/A | - Linked lists are traversed __iteratively__ (sequentially).<br> - In a __single-linked list__, each node contains a pointer to the next node, but __not__ the previous node.<br> - In a __doubly-linked list__, each node contains pointers to both the next __and__ the previous nodes.<br> &ensp; - A doubly-linked list that additionally maintains both __head__ and __tail__ pointers can be used to efficiently implement a __queue__. | -_Fast and slow pointers_: ...<br> - Know how to reverse a linked list! |
| Stack*                | `std::stack` | - A LIFO data structure.<br> - Supports the following constant time $O(1)$ operations:<br> &ensp; - `push` (insertion)<br> &ensp; - `top` (access the top element)<br> &ensp; - `pop` (remove the top element) | - Suitable for any problem where you recognize the __LIFO pattern__.<br> - These problems will involve the elements of the input interacting with each other in some way, e.g.<br> &ensp; - matching elements together.<br> &ensp; - querying some property, e.g. _distance to next largest element_. |
| Queue*                | `std::queue` | - A FIFO data structure.<br> - Supports the following constant time $O(1)$ operations:<br> &ensp; - `push` (insert element at end)<br> &ensp; - `pop` (remove first element)<br> &ensp; - `front` (access the first element)<br> &ensp; - `back` (access the last element) | - Suitable for any problem where you recognize the __FIFO pattern__, e.g.<br> &ensp; - moving average of a data stream.<br> - Queues are primarily uased to implement __Breadth First Search (BFS)__. |
| Deque*                | `std::deque` | Constant time $O(1)$ __access__, __insertion__ and __removal__ at both ends.<br> &ensp; - `push_front`, `push_back` (insertion at front or back)<br> &ensp; - `front`, `back` (access first or last element)<br> &ensp; - `pop_front`, `pop_back` (remove first or last element) | ... |
| Binary Tree          | N/A | - The __root__ node has no parent and is positioned at the _top_ of the tree.<br> - A __leaf__ node has no children.<br> - The __depth__ of a node is how far it is from the root.<br> - A __subtree__ is a given node and all its descendants.<br> - Binary trees are traversed __recursively__.<br> - All nodes have a maximum of __two children__.<br> | - The idea of __subtrees__ is fundamental to solving binary tree problems.<br> - Treating a given node as its own subtree allows these problems to be solved __recursively__ via either __DFS__ or __BFS__. |
| Binary Search Tree (BST) | N/A | A __binary search tree__ is a binary tree that has the following additional properties:<br> &ensp; - All values in a node's left subtree are less than the node's value.<br> &ensp; - All values in a node's right subtree are greater than the node's value.<br> &ensp; - All values in a BST are __unique__. | - __In-order__ DFS traversal (prioritizing left over right) will handle nodes in __sorted__ order. |
| Graph                | N/A | - Graphs have the following properties:<br> &ensp; - __Edges__ can be __directed__ or __undirected__.<br> &ensp; - A __connected componment__ is a group of connected nodes (__vertices__).<br> &ensp; - A graph can be either __cyclic__ (containing one or more cycles) or __acyclic__.<br> &ensp; - Binary trees are __directed, acyclic__ graphs.<br> Traversal is done via iteration over the neighbors of the current node. | - Graph problems can be either explicit or implicit:<br> &ensp; - explicit: __array of edges__, __adjacency list__, __adjacency matrix__, __matrix__.<br> &ensp; - implicit graphs will involve modeling a transition between two states as two or more connected nodes whose connecting edges represent the range of possible state transitions, e.g. [Minimum Genetic Mutation](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-genetic-mutation/).  |
| Heap                 | `std::priority_queue`<br> `std::make_heap` | - Accessing the "top" (min/max) element in $O(1)$.<br> - Inserting a new element or removing the "top" element in $O(\log n)$.| - Use a heap to repeatedly find the min/max element.<br> - Any type of problem that asks for the __top `k` elements__. |

*It's worth noting that stacks and queues are higher level containers than `std::deque`, `std::vector` or `std::list`, i.e. both a stack and queue can be constructed from the lower level containers. In other words, __stack and queue are simply restrictions on a deque__.
